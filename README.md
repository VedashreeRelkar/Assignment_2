# Assignment_2
For task 1 , a varibale is assignmed to take input from user for a number. If-else statment is further used to print whether the number is even or odd. If the remainder after dividing the number by 2 is not equal to zero, it means the number is odd. Else, it is an even number. Basis this logic, the statment is printed.
For task 2, a varibale "sum" is asigned initial value as zero so that it can start incremental function for loop. Then for loop is used to iterate numbers from 1 to 50 by using range as (1,51). Then print line of code is added to display the expected output.
